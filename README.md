# Car Insurance Cold Calls Data Analysis using Hive(HQL) and SQL

Leveraged Google Dataproc as my Hadoop cluster to efficiently store data for parallel processing. Seamlessly transferred files from local storage using Gcloud CLI. Conducted in-depth data analysis using Hive Query Language (HQL) and SQL to extract valuable insights from the dataset.


## Tasks

1. Data Loading: Set the foundation by loading data into the Hadoop cluster.

2. Data Exploration: Delved into the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

3. Aggregations: Performed essential aggregations to gain high-level insights.

4. Partitioning and Bucketing: Optimized data storage for enhanced efficiency.

5. Optimized Joins: Ensured seamless merging of datasets for comprehensive analysis.

6. Window Function: Employed window functions for nuanced data manipulation.

7. Advanced Aggregations: Unearthed deeper insights through advanced aggregation techniques.

8. Complex Joins and Aggregations: Tackled complex data relationships with finesse.

9. Performance Tuning: Fine-tuned the entire process for optimal performance.
